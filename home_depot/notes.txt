There are product attributes for some products. there are product descriptions for each product and can be merged on the produt_uid.

perhaps a model that is ONLY trained off the product title

another model that is ONLY using the description

another model that uses BOTH PT and PD

and then another model that uses the product attributes 
	BECAUSE it is NOT a complete file (1-to-1), it can only train for "what's there"

there is also a combined fourth model that uses them all

then there are flavors of models:
random forest
logistic regression
SVM
ANN

TF/IDF and cosine matrix for them all. the "distance" metric seems like it would be skewed if there are missing values though.

---- PROCESS

* run spell check on the data and save a "clean file"
* run a stop-words on the data and save a "clean file"
* conduct a root-word analysis 
	--> how??? 


Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on the root mean squared error (RMSE).


Submission File

For each id in the test set, you must predict a relevance. This is a real number in [1,3]. The file should contain a header and have the following format:
id,relevance
1,1
4,2
5,3
