INPUT:

query:  search term(s) used
prod_desc: full desc w/ HTML
median_relevance(3 raters) :: 1 to 4 :: int
relevance_variane: SD (!!) of scores by raters (not variance as in desc)

 --> can use dictionary / thesauri


OUTPUT:
id 
prediction: (int) 1 to 4  
	--> softlayer output (vs sigmoid)
	--> for predict in prediction ARGMAX(predict) (iirc)

Basic Numbers:
* 10,158 inputs
* Meidan Score: 3.3098
* Mix of "has/doesn't have desc" (w/ mixed results) 
	--> MAKE FEATURE: bool has/doesn't have desc (TEST VAR)
* Some HTML (most not) so stripe it 
	-> MAKE FEATURE"had HTML" (TEST VAR)



 * (SET OF) FEATURE (s)
	--> match of "exact" phrase in desc
	--> match of "portion" phrase in desc 
		** make it a loop (?) that by length makes a (few?) tries to find matches in desc
			+ selection via "length of word" (?) or "max char length" (based on combination?)
			+ ex: 5 wrds in desc: search for exact 2 or 3 (?)
				--> take 






if you want to reverse-engineer from (median_relevance, rel_sd) back to the set of individual ratings, that can be done (create a lookup table) and might or might not give insight, so e.g.

median_relevance=4, rel_sd=0.0 -> ratings were (4,4,4)

median_relevance=4, rel_sd=0.471 -> ratings were (4,4,3)

median_relevance=4, rel_sd=0.943 -> ratings were (4,4,2)
median_relevance=4, rel_sd=1.414 -> ratings were (4,4,1)

and the rarer tuples with n>3 (about ~7% of training set):

median_relevance=4, rel_sd=0.4 -> ratings were (4,4,4,4,3)

median_relevance=4, rel_sd=0.433 -> ratings were (4,4,4,3)

median_relevance=4, rel_sd=0.49 -> ratings were (4,4,4,3,3)

median_relevance=4, rel_sd=0.8 -> ratings were (4,4,4,3,2)

median_relevance=4, rel_sd=1.166 -> ratings were (4,4,4,3,1)

median_relevance=4, rel_sd=1.265 -> ratings were (4,4,4,2,1)




(?<!...)
Matches if the current position in the string is not preceded by a match for .... This is called a negative lookbehind assertion. Similar to positive lookbehind assertions, the contained pattern must only match strings of some fixed length and shouldn’t contain group references. Patterns which start with negative lookbehind assertions may match at the beginning of the string being searched.


prog = re.compile(pattern)
result = prog.match(string)
is equivalent to

result = re.match(pattern, string)

re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0)
Return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one group. Empty matches are included in the result unless they touch the beginning of another match.


matchObj = re.match( r'dogs', line, re.M|re.I)
re.I	Performs case-insensitive matching.

V6:  - same min_coverage but w/ tweak to calculation :: concretely, removal of pt_part
	- also adjustment to calculation of "distance" rather than just the first and last pairs being subtracted, i subtract them all
	- from literature, it appears i *may* be suppose to subtract each pair from one another and then select the min distance from all those different combinations. it's unclear.

- because of git issues, i re-ran v4 to verify i could reproduce the results. √√√√√√  :)

V6-2 :: adjustment to min_coverage
	- MinCover is defined as the length of the shortest document segment that covers each query term at least once in a document. In the above example, if the query is {t1,t2}, its MinCover would be 2, but if the query is {t1,t2,t4}, its MinCover would be 5 (the length of the segment from the second position to the sixth position).
	--> shooting to better calcuate the min_coverage so that if it's only two terms, then it's the distance between the two but if it's three+ terms, then its' the distance from the last two terms in the locations array --> maybe they need to be sorted?? 


svm-v6-2.csv

	- boolean, mean matches && min_coverages : 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,11,14,16,18,19,20,21,22,23,24
	- still not an improvement (but better than v6-1 and v5-1) @ 0.35093
	- seems to be a general downward pressure on the labels -> 4s to 3s, etc 


v7:  
	- pursuing "min pair distance"  √
	Definition 3 (Minimum pair distance (MinDist)) The minimum pair distance is defined as the smallest distance value of all pairs of unique 	matched query terms. Formally, MinDist = minq1,q2∈Q∩D,q16=q2 {Dis(q1, q2; D)}.  
	For example, the MinDist of the example document d for query Q = {t1,t2,t3} is 1.
	--> requires doing a subtraction for each distance within the locations and then choosing the LOWEST value

	--> WILL ALSO consider a "sort" on the distances so that we really are getting the min distance √
	: right now, the algo just takes the "last two" to derive the distance 
		when it should probably be sorted and THEN calc distance based on last two in array
	--> evaluate titles and desc separately (rather than as one assignment) 

	-- found a bug in v6 where it wasn't quite accounting for all the variants of query_ln < 2   √
		-- believe it's fixed now

 ** the changes you made to the length (not pair, but min distance) appear to get lower numbers now that you've sorted them

V8:  INTRODUCTION OF SIMILIARITIES 
	-- for TITLE ONLY 

svm-v8-1.csv
	- sim (title only), booleans (all): 1,4,23,26,27
	- ran with beat-benchmark because was having issues with ../ml.py
		--> the score was NEGATIVE? and the output was MOSTLY 4s and 2s. didn't see any 1s or 3s
	- HOWEVER, i wanted to simply run it through beat-benchmark WITHOUT the tf/idf but it was "breaking" when i did that

	- sim (title only), booleans (all): 1,4,23,26,27
	- Network: 20, 50  --> as "quickie" because tried to run at 20,500 but after 45 min it hadn't finished and suspecting issue with code (for some reason)
	==> note as "softmaxlayer"  :: 
	--> had an issue with the selection of best (missing .argmax)

	- same as svm-v8-1 but w/ nn (EXCEPT no TF/IDF)
	- sim (title only), booleans (all): 1,4,23,26,27
	- Network: 10, 200  (since i know it WILL finish)
	- used softmaxlayer and the output was all 1's. not sure wtf is wrong with the network. switching back to sigmoid (for probability)

nn-v8-2.csv
	- same as svm-v8-1 but w/ nn (EXCEPT no TF/IDF)
	- sim (title only), booleans (all): 1,4,23,26,27
	- Network: 10, 200  :: using sigmoid -- > looks like for softmaxlayer you just use preds.argmax() and that's it (not the index)

nn-v8-2.csv
	- sim (title), boolean (pt_part): 1,4
	- 20, 100
	- Output was only 1's & 4s (mostly 4s)


 TO DO:  try to create a NN work with the word vector that maps to the query (which is ALSO turned into a vector) ??

*** MORE EXPERIMENTS:
	- verify distance and min_coverage are good (no bugs)  √

		== for tf/idf and for sim between pt and query (re-run for v9)

	- cosine 

**** V9 ***** 
	-> re-run of bool w/ tweak to stoplist (for similiarity)
	--> when running the actual svm, will start experimenting with mixes of title and description	
	--> cosine still not working
	--> ALSO includes query length (so will need to experiment with that a bit...NO IDEA if it will help)

V9 - ATTEMPT at adding "cosine" of tfidf vectors. it's a ratio of the query & prod_title as a product (of q & p_t) divided by their absolute product
	- also addition of a few measurement words to the stoplist



-------

IDEAS ::
 - from reading the 1st place finish from FB competition, it appears it's "okay" to REMOVE data from a test set
	-> for example, maybe remove "4s and 3s" where the product title has ZERO matches
	-> get counts for 4s with NO pd --> candidate?
		--> 3s & 4s w/ no PD == 5917 @ 4s: 4554  
		--> NOT a good idea to remove since MOST of the 3s and 4s don't have PDs
			--> INDICATIVE OF FOCUSING ON product titles!!

 - looking for "anaomolies" --> products w/ 3s and 4s but NO pt_part or pd_part
	--> 72 @ rating == 4
	-->  56  --> see below for list

		--> what if there was an "is_anamalous" flag? such that if it's a 1 or 2 but it's an EXACT match
			@ 1 or 2 w/ PT_EXACT == 35
	OR "is_anamalous" if 3 or 4 BUT no PT / PD_PART? 
			(per above) == 128

	--> after getting score am going to look at how often these anamolies occur within the TEST set to see how i should approach the next step

	:: BEFORE flat-out removing the data from the training set, i'm going to instead focus on creating a boolean of anom_typeA and anom_typeB : A : no match for pt / pd but 3 or 4; B == exact match but 1 or 2 (v10)

- can additionally look into splitting the 3- and 4-word+ from being one group
	:: 4-word queries == 925
	:: 5-word+ == 150

	--> this all feeds into a good vote / blending option

  :: TRAINING /TEST V10 ::

using a cf_y_alt1:
	- has all ana_typeA and _typeB REMOVED from file
 	--> FYI after looking at anamolies they may be synomnyms like "fridge" for "refrigerator" 
	--> dictionary (???) or theasaurs?  if ana_typeA -> use thesaurus?

  :: having some issues w/ the loop. going to just scrub v9 and call it v10.
	->> spiderman consistently off . harely davidson consistently off. spellcheck would catch 90%+ of refrigerator
	--> created CUSTOM TRAIN:  cf_train_alt1-a.csv (where i removed all bad rows)
svm-v10-1.csv
	- sim, tf/idf, pt-part: 1, 5
	score: 0.613 @ 275, 10
	--> surprisingly lower score: .56325

	- brandname dictionary 
		spiderman vs spider-man
		harleydavidson vs harley-davidson / harley davidson
		iphone vs iphone case, etc
	- quilts and bedspreads


---- BETTER :: 
	- look up the query on walmart: what is the category (and potentially sub /parent)
	- loop up the PRODUCT on walmart: what is the category (and potentially sub/parent)
	--> matches?   if query and product are in the "same category" that's also pretty telling...

V12 - uses categories
	-> for this version we did a quick BOOLEAN: it's either the EXACT same category or it's NOT
	-> also note that we reviewed the 36+/- TypeA and TypeB anomalies
		:: FOR TYPE A ANOMALIES :: ISSUE :: thesaurus stuff. Category matches will PROBABLY solve problem...
		:: may need to use a thesaurus though... 
		:: FOR V12, it may make sense to simply remove these from the TRAINING set, knowing the problem will persist for TEST but at least the training will be cleaner... hmmm
	:: LOTS of fails in the test sets for PTs. --> maybe i want to take a look at similarities between query and categories? 
		--> either way, look into what these failures are... :(
:: CURRENT PLAN :: if pt or query == 0, then it STAYS 0. If they match, then == 1; if they DO NOT MATCH, then == -1
	--> had a quick issue w/ how i coded anamolies for v12 (failed for test) so I REMOVED the feature in v12
	--> can evaluate using it again in the future by accepting that there will NO anamolies in the test set
		--> IMO that results in it being a useless feature since there'd be none in the test evaluation to pick up on it...
